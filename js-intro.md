#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a piece of code that can take any number of inputs and returns an output.  It can be repeatably called.  It is valuable in solving problems, manipulating data, or generally making your program alive.
#### 2. What is a method?
A method is a function that can be performed on objects (including arrays and strings).  Methods are associated with classes and object prototypes.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.length(), .indexOf(), .toUpperCase()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
accessor methods are used to access certain pieces of information within an object.  Mutator methods change the object is some way.  You would use accessors if you wanted to use the data within the object in a function.  You use mutators if you want to change the information within an object.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
return internally stores the output for a function.  This information is becomes the value of a function call.  console.log is used to print information to the console.  When you want to see the results you use console lot, if you don't want to clutter your consol with excessive information you can use returns.  It is good practice to end a function with a return statement.
